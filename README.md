# Autonomous_Car_tx2_Brain_V1
Hello 
My team hoban is trying to make autonomous car using GPU board TX2 and zed stereo camera.
We use S/W tools jetpack 3.2 , ROS kinetic, ZED sdk 2.4.1, CUDA 9.0 etc(i will keep updateing)
We use TX2 as our system's brain so we use controller which raspberry pi2 is control esc on the car
I am a beginner in s/w so my code is weak 
I hope you guys send me email(chijepark@gmail.com) or massage, if my code is wrong or trouble.
Thanks

In hoba autonomous car Version1
We just use GPU Open CV API and line detection(hough algorithm ransac algorithm)
just send steering information to pi

In hoba autononous car Version2
We are going to develop using DeepLearing or SLAM 
I will.
